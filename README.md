# crypto-allocation
This repository explores methods for allocating assets within a cryptocurrency portfolio, risk management, and performance optimization. 


## environment
i'm using python 3.11

## ideas
1. You can analyze risk and possible returns through previous historical data.
2. I'm exploring few approach to calculate assets allocations with higher returns or least volatility.
3. I'm still exploring few ways to obtain historical price data. Currently, I'm using Coinbase pro wrapper but some new altcoins are not available.
4. You still need to prepare your own datasets before running the main script.
5. I'm collecting existing code/scripts. I will post the original authors/contributors, just did this code in a few hours.
6. Feel free to optimize/develop new approach. You can make pull requests!
